# 💬 Sentiment Analysis using Python

This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It classifies input text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentiment polarity.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The notebook covers:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag of Words.
- Model training using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualizations like word clouds and sentiment distribution plots.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Analyze product reviews, tweets, or customer feedback.
- Build an intelligent chatbot.
- Track brand or public sentiment over time.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK 
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud
